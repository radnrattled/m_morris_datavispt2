	<div class="box1"><p>When you look at the Olympic gold Medal data as a total you will find that Men hold more Medals than Women. However, upon closer and more equal analysis you will find that Women, once they have gained momentum in not only sports but simultaniously bsic human rights, will gain and surpass the gold Medal earning Power of men. <br><br>
	Our total medal counts include the beginning of the olympics where very little women had the opportunity to compete. But as we break down the years we can see where women were afforded the same opportunites to compete and actually perform better.</p></div>
